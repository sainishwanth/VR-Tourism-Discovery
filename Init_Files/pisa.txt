The Leaning Tower of Pisa, an iconic architectural marvel located in Pisa, Italy, stands as a testament to both human error and resilience. Originally intended as a freestanding bell tower for the adjacent cathedral, the tower began to lean during construction due to unstable ground. Despite attempts to correct its tilt, including modifications to subsequent levels, the tower continued to lean, resulting in its distinctive slanted appearance. Completed in 1372, the tower's unintended lean has only added to its allure, drawing millions of visitors annually to marvel at its unique design and engineering anomaly. Today, the Leaning Tower of Pisa stands as a symbol of human perseverance, showcasing the enduring legacy of medieval Italian craftsmanship and ingenuity.
