The Burj Khalifa, formerly known as the Burj Dubai, stands as an iconic skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and is recognized as the world's tallest structure. Soaring to a total height of 829.8 meters (2,722 feet) and featuring a roof height of 828 meters (2,717 feet), it has held the title of the tallest building and structure globally since its completion in 2009, surpassing the Taipei 101.

The construction of the Burj Khalifa commenced in 2004, culminating in its exterior completion in 2009. The primary structure consists of reinforced concrete, and some of the structural steel used in the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament. The skyscraper officially opened in 2010 as the centerpiece of the expansive development known as Downtown Dubai. This ambitious project aimed to diversify Dubai's economy from its reliance on oil and gain international recognition.

Named in honor of the former president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Burj Khalifa's construction was financially supported by Abu Dhabi and the UAE government to assist Dubai in managing its debts. The skyscraper broke numerous height records, including its designation as the world's tallest building, showcasing its architectural and engineering prowess.

The design of the Burj Khalifa was led by a team headed by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the same firm responsible for the design of the Sears Tower in Chicago. The architectural inspiration draws from Islamic architecture, particularly seen in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry optimizes residential and hotel space, with a central core and wings supporting the building's height. The exterior features a cladding system designed to withstand Dubai's hot temperatures. The structure houses 57 elevators and 8 escalators, emphasizing efficiency in vertical transportation.

In the course of the project, financial challenges arose, prompting Sheikh Khalifa, the then-ruler of the UAE, to provide additional funding, leading to the name change from "Burj Dubai" to "Burj Khalifa." The profitability of the venture stemmed from the development of high-density projects and malls surrounding the landmark, contributing significantly to revenue, while the Burj Khalifa itself may not have generated substantial profit.

Opened on January 4, 2010, the Burj Khalifa is located in Downtown Dubai, forming part of a 2 square kilometer (490-acre) development along Sheikh Zayed Road. The primary contractor for construction was Samsung C&T of South Korea, working alongside local company Arabtec and the Belgian group BESIX.

Designed as the centerpiece of a mixed-use development, the Burj Khalifa was envisioned to include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), extensive parkland, residential skyscrapers, the Dubai Mall, and the artificial Burj Khalifa Lake. The decision to build the Burj Khalifa reflected the government's strategic shift towards a service and tourism-based economy, aiming for international recognition and increased investment.

Despite its positive critical reception and numerous awards, the project faced criticism for the treatment of migrant workers involved in its construction, highlighting issues such as low wages and passport confiscation. The Burj Khalifa remains a symbol of Dubai's ambitious urban development and economic diversification, standing as a testament to architectural and engineering excellence on the global stage.
