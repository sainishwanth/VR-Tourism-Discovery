The Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família, commonly referred to as the Sagrada Família, is a monumental church situated in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. As one of the most renowned architectural marvels worldwide, it stands as the largest unfinished Catholic church globally. The brainchild of the esteemed Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, whose work on the Sagrada Família is enshrined as part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the church embodies a fusion of Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau elements.

Construction of the Sagrada Família commenced on 19 March 1882 under the direction of architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. However, Gaudí assumed leadership in 1883 after Villar's resignation, radically transforming the project with his innovative architectural and engineering vision. Gaudí dedicated the remainder of his life to the church, considering it his ultimate masterpiece. Tragically, at the time of his death in 1926, only a fraction of the project was completed, with estimates ranging from 15 to 25 percent.

Funding for the Sagrada Família has relied entirely on private donations, leading to a slow and intermittent construction process further hampered by the Spanish Civil War. The project suffered significant setbacks during the conflict, including damage to Gaudí's original plans by anarchists in 1936. Despite these challenges, construction persisted, with intermittent progress in the subsequent decades.

The use of advancements in technology, such as computer-aided design and computerized numerical control, has facilitated accelerated progress since the mid-20th century. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain, including the completion of five additional spires, each symbolizing key figures from the New Testament. Originally projected for completion by 2026, the centenary of Gaudí's death, delays have ensued, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with some estimations suggesting a potential completion date as late as 2040.

Critically acclaimed for its unprecedented design, the Sagrada Família has garnered praise from architectural luminaries and critics alike. Described by art critic Rainer Zerbst as an unparalleled marvel in the annals of art history, and by Paul Goldberger as a transcendent interpretation of Gothic architecture, the basilica's distinctive silhouette has become emblematic of Barcelona itself, attracting millions of visitors annually.

However, opinions on the Sagrada Família have been polarized. While esteemed architects like Louis Sullivan and Walter Gropius extol its virtues as a pinnacle of creative architecture, others, such as George Orwell and James A. Michener, have criticized its unconventional design. Nevertheless, the Sagrada Família's designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site underscores its significance as a testament to Gaudí's exceptional creative contribution to architectural development.

In recent years, efforts have intensified to advance construction, with the appointment of Jordi Faulí i Oller as chief architect in 2012. Significant progress has been made, with Faulí announcing in 2015 that construction had entered its final phase, aiming for completion of the main structure and six immense steeples by 2026. Visitor entrance fees contribute to the annual construction budget, estimated at €25 million.

Today, the Sagrada Família stands as not only a religious edifice but also a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance, embodying Gaudí's enduring legacy and Barcelona's cultural identity. Its ongoing construction serves as a symbol of hope and aspiration, inspiring generations to come.
